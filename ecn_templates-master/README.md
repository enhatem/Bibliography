## Reports

Latex (`report` folder) and Word (`word` folder) are available.

For Latex, modify the file `thesisfront.tex` to set your name, thesis, jury, date, etc.

For the bibliography reports, change 'Master Thesis Report' to 'Thesis bibliography report'.

## Presentations

A beamer template is available in the `beamer` folder. No template for Powerpoint at this time.

## Latex syntax example

In the `ieeeexample` folder is the full tex file of a IEEE article with the corresponding PDF.

It will not fully compile on your computer as the figures are not included, but you can find many examples of syntaxes: equations, tables, algorithms, figures and multiple figures.

Feel free to modify the templates and suggest any improvements.
